# home-assessment-workbook
Use this workbook to predict your neighborhood home assessments. This will require that you can obtain all of your neighborhood tax data from a publicly available location. 

## How do I use this? 
Clear all of the data from the "Data" tab and fill it in with your neighborhood's information. This information should be able to be sourced from your county's tax assessment website [here's one example](https://iaspublicaccess.fultoncountyga.gov/search/CommonSearch.aspx?mode=ADDRESS) and [here's another example](http://www.gwinnettassessor.manatron.com/IWantTo/PropertyGISSearch.aspx). In order for comparison to work properly, you should be able to get the following items from the tax site: 

- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Sqft size of lot
- Sqft size of house
- Last sold Date
- Last sold amount (USD)
